    longDescription: |
      Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly
      interactive maps. Weighing just about 39 KB of JS, it has all the mapping
      [features](https://leafletjs.com/#features) most developers ever need.


      Leaflet is designed with _simplicity_, _performance_ and _usability_ in
      mind. It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms,
      can be extended with lots of
      [plugins](https://leafletjs.com/plugins.html), has a beautiful, easy to
      use and [well-documented API](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html
      "Leaflet API reference") and a simple, readable [source
      code](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet "Leaflet source code repository
      on GitHub") that is a joy to
      [contribute](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
